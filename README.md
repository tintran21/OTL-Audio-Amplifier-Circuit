# ðŸ”Š OTL Audio Amplifier - 30W Single-Ended ðŸ”Š

## Project Description
This is a group project aimed at calculating, simulating, designing, and practically implementing a single-ended input OTL amplifier circuit based on given specifications.
(Developed at the end of 2024)
## Group Members
- **tintran21**
- **thanhtra3105**
  
## Design Requirements
- Amplifier type: OTL (Output Transformer-Less)
- Input: Single-ended
- Output power: 30W
- Input impedance: 150kÎ©
- Load impedance: 4Î©
- Total Harmonic Distortion (THD): â‰¤ 0.2%

## Circuit Versions
We developed two circuit versions

### Version 1:
- Uses **2 pairs of Darlington transistors**

### Version 2:
- Uses **3 pairs of Darlington transistors**

**Both versions are stable; in the final report, we chose the circuit with 2 pairs of Darlington transistors**
  
## Tools Used
- Proteus 8.16 (Circuit simulation and testing)
- Altium 20.2 (Schematic and PCB Design)
