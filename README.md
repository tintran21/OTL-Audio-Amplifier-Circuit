# 🔊 OTL Audio Amplifier - 30W Single-Ended 🔊

## Project Description

This is a group project aimed at calculating, simulating, designing, and practically implementing a single-ended input OTL amplifier circuit based on given specifications. (Developed at the end of 2024)

## Group Members

- **tintran21**
- **thanhtra3105**

## Design Requirements

- Amplifier type: OTL (Output Transformer-Less)
- Input: Single-ended
- Output power: 30W
- Input impedance: 150kΩ
- Load impedance: 4Ω
- Total Harmonic Distortion (THD): ≤ 0.2%

## Circuit Versions

We developed two circuit versions

### Version 1

- Uses 2 pairs of Darlington transistors

### Version 2

- Uses 3 pairs of Darlington transistors

Both versions are stable; in the final report, we chose the circuit with 2 pairs of Darlington transistors

## Tools Used

- Proteus 8.16 (Circuit simulation and testing)
- Altium 20.2 (Schematic and PCB Design)
